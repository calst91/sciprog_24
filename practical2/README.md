# Practical 2

This folder contains the codes for practical 2.

Conversion.c takes a decimal number and converts it to a binary number.

Sum.c adds the inverse of numbers from 1 up to 1000. It then also computes
the sum of of the inverse of number from 1000 down to 1. The two sums are then
substracted from each other to showcase the inaccuracies of the operation.

## Compiling  of each code

* gcc Conversion.c -o conversion -lm
* gcc Sum.c -o sum -lm

## Execution of each code

* ./conversion


* ./sum
