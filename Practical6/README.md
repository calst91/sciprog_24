# Practical 6

This folder contains the codes for Practical 6.

matrixprod.c computes the product of two matrices of different sizes
main.c contains the main part of the matrixprod.c code and mm.c contains
the functions used. Makefile automates the compiling process for the main.c
and mm.c files on a single command. It generates both object files and 
executable files on a single run.

This is useful when a code contains many functions.

## Compiling the codes

* gcc matrixprod.c -o matrixProduct

* make

## Execution

* ./matrixProduct

* ./mmc
