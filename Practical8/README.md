# Practical 8

This folder contains the files for course practical 8. 
The file gcd.c contains two function recursiveGCD and iterativeGCD that 
returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a pair of integers passed 
as arguments. The GCD of two or more non-zero integers is the larget 
positive integer that divides the numbers without a remainder.
The two functions are used in the main body of the program to find the 
GCD of two numbers. Result shows same output from the two methods of 
computation.

## Compile

* gcc gcd.c -o gcd

## Execution

* ./gcd
