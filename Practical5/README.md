# Practical 4

This folder contain the codes for practical 5.

fibunacci.c formulates and display the fibunacci series up to the user 
defined value of n.

arctan.c uses two methods, i.e., the McLaurin Series method and the 
natural logarithmic method, to compute the Inverse Hyperbolic Tangent 
function.

## Compiling Each Code

* gcc fibunacci.c -o fibunacci -lm

* gcc arctan.c -o arctan -lm

## Execution

* ./fibunacci

* ./arctan
